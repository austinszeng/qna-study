# QnA Study
A small program to help study and memorize material from class

## To implement:
- an average score from the number of attempts when retrying
- choice of whether to display an answer is correct or incorrect
- a database to store how many times a question has been answered wrong and offer a retest with those questions in particular 

## Customizing questions and answers
When typing questions and answers into the qna.txt file, always separate them with an empty line as so:

1. question 1?
2. question 2?
3. question 3?
^
1. answer 1
2. answer 2
3. answer 3

It is unnecessary to add the question numbers in front of the questions and answers in any certain format -- or at all -- as long as the questions match up to their answers after the empty line.

## Additional commands
At any time, you can skip a question by typing `s` or quit by typing `q`.
